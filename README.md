Python scripts to download folders and files from google drive.
I had to create this to solve a simple problem: download the whole folder structure and files shared with me on Google Drive (more than 200 files, totaling aprox 10Gbytes). I was unable to synchronize that folder structure using the Google Drive application for Windows, and also to download from the web interface, because Google Drive Web tryed to compress everything before downloading - and got lost with such a big set of files.

Pre-requisites - Authorize API usage on google drive, and download/install google drive pyhton api. 
Follow instructions on : https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/quickstart/python
To install python client on windows:
pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client

Download the client_secret.json to same dir as this script

Usage: to replicate a Gogle Drive folder structure with all files, in your computer
python dl_gdrive_folder.py <Google drive folder source> <local computer folder destination>
Example:
Folder Structure at Google Drive:
F1
	File0
	F11
		File1
	F12
		F211
			FileA
			FileB
To download everything from folder F211 to a local folder TST
python dl_gdrive_folder.py F211 TST
